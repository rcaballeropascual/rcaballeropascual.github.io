									<h2>METHODS OF CHARACTER CREATION I</h2>
									<p>What are the characters and why do they matter in Narrative Design?</p>

									<h2>What are the characters in a story?</h2>
								</header>
								<p><strong>Characters are the emotional and functional engine of any story.</strong>
									Beyond the empathetic bond the audience may form with them, it is their decisions,
									conflicts, and transformations that drive the plot forward and give it meaning. This
									is true in traditional media such as film or literature, but also —and increasingly—
									in video games.</p>

								<p>In any video game, whether linear or open-world, the player moves through a virtual
									environment that needs to feel inhabited. Whether it’s the post-apocalyptic Boston
									of <strong>The Last of Us</strong> (Naughty Dog, 2013), the kingdom of Lucis in
									<strong>Final Fantasy XV</strong> (Square Enix, 2016), or the chaotic planet Pandora
									in <strong>Borderlands 2</strong> (Gearbox Software, 2012), these worlds require
									actors who not only populate them but also bring them to life and push the narrative
									forward.
								</p>

								<h2>Types of characters in video games</h2>

								<p>In general terms, we can distinguish two major categories:</p>

								<ul>
									<li><strong>Playable Characters (PCs):</strong> The player has direct control over
										them, turning them into their avatar within the game world.</li>
									<li><strong>Non-Playable Characters (NPCs):</strong> They can be allies, enemies, or
										simple inhabitants of the environment. Within this group, it is common to find:
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Active NPCs</strong>, with AI and more complex behaviors.</li>
											<li><strong>Passive NPCs</strong>, who serve environmental functions and
												usually follow simple, repetitive routines.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>

								</div>

								<h2>Why even “minor” characters need to be well constructed?</h2>

								<p>Although players understand that a video game represents reality in a stylized way,
									<strong>immersion breaks</strong> when characters behave incoherently or too
									mechanically. However, <strong>building a good character</strong> does not
									necessarily mean giving them a deep backstory. It is more about assigning the
									<strong>right narrative traits</strong> according to their function in the gameplay.
								</p>

								<p>A clear example appears in <strong>Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus</strong>
									(MachineGames,
									2017). The Nazi soldiers the protagonist fights are cloned enemies whose only
									purpose is to die. They don’t need emotional arcs or tragic pasts, but they do need
									to be coherent: <strong>if they are Nazi soldiers, they should speak
										German.</strong> This seemingly small detail reinforces immersion and helps
									differentiate the game from other shooters.</p>

								<h2>The narrative designer’s challenge</h2>

								<p>When dealing with characters who are truly relevant to the story, assigning them a
									language or a functional role is not enough. <strong>Creating compelling characters
										is essential</strong> because they are the <strong>primary anchor</strong> for
									<strong>player engagement</strong>. If players connect with them (emotionally,
									morally, or even through conflict) they become invested in the story that surrounds
									them. A well‑constructed character can elevate
									the narrative, strengthen immersion, and give meaning to the player’s actions within
									the game world. This leads to the central question that guides this series of
									articles:
								</p>

								<p>
									<center><strong>How to build a truly interesting character?</strong></center>
								</p>

								<p>This first installment has laid the groundwork: what we mean by <strong>“character”
										in the context of narrative design</strong>, and why their construction matters
									even when their role is minimal.</p>

								<h2>A look at what’s coming next...</h2>

								<p>In the following entries, we will explore <strong>four (4) different methods of
										character
										construction</strong>, each with its own logic and very different applications
									within narrative design. These will be the focus of the series:</p>

								<ol>
									<li><strong>The Four Hippocratic Temperaments</strong>: A classical system that
										categorizes people according to their temperament —choleric, sanguine,
										phlegmatic, and melancholic— and which, surprisingly, remains a useful tool for
										defining behaviors and dynamics between characters.</li>
									<li><strong>Jung’s 8 Personality Types</strong>: A psychological framework that
										helps explain how characters perceive the world and how they make decisions. It
										is especially useful for designing coherent internal motivations and contrasts
										within a cast.</li>
									<li><strong>The Archetypes of the Monomyth</strong>: Based on the structure of the
										“hero’s journey,” these archetypes allow you to place each character within a
										clear narrative function: mentor, threshold guardian, herald, shadow… A powerful
										way to understand the role they play in the story.</li>
									<li><strong>Kodaka’s Method</strong>: A more contemporary and unconventional
										approach, presented by Kazutaka Kodaka at GDC 2015. His technique starts by
										combining contradictory traits to create memorable, unpredictable, and nuanced
										characters. It is one of my favorite methods due to its freshness and direct
										applicability to narrative design.</li>
								</ol>
